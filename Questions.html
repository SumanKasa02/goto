                        <h3>4. Explain digital signature along with its working mechanism.</h3>
                        <p>A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. It provides a secure way to sign electronic documents and ensures that the message has not been tampered with during transmission. Digital signatures are based on asymmetric encryption, which involves two keys:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Private Key:</b> A secret key used to encrypt the digital signature. This key is kept private by the signer.</li>
                          <li><b>Public Key:</b> A public key that anyone can use to verify the authenticity of the digital signature.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The working mechanism of a digital signature is as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>The sender generates a hash value (a unique digital fingerprint) of the message or document.</li>
                          <li>The sender encrypts the hash value with their private key, creating the digital signature.</li>
                          <li>The signed message and the digital signature are sent to the recipient.</li>
                          <li>The recipient decrypts the digital signature using the sender's public key to retrieve the hash value.</li>
                          <li>The recipient then generates their own hash of the received message and compares it with the decrypted hash value. If they match, the message is authentic, and its integrity is intact.</li>
                        </ol>
