                        <h2>Short Answer Questions</h2>

                        <h3>1. What is data in the context of a DBMS?</h3>
                        <p>Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures such as numbers, names, or dates. In a DBMS, data is stored in structured formats to be organized and made meaningful through processing.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. How does information differ from data?</h3>
                        <p>Information is processed data that has been structured and given context to be useful. Unlike raw data, information helps in decision-making and provides meaningful insights.</p>
                       
                        <h3>3. What is a database?</h3>
                        <p>A database is an organized collection of related data stored electronically. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data using database software.</p>
                        
                        <h3>4. What are the main features of a DBMS?</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Ensures data integrity and consistency</li>
                          <li>Provides security against unauthorized access</li>
                          <li>Supports backup and recovery</li>
                          <li>Allows concurrent data access</li>
                          <li>Maintains data independence</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>5. List two advantages and two disadvantages of using a DBMS.</h3>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Centralized data management</li>
                          <li>Reduced data redundancy</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>High initial setup cost</li>
                          <li>Requires regular maintenance and skilled personnel</li>
                        </ul>                        
                        
                        <h3>6. What is a relational database model?</h3>
                        <p>The relational model organizes data into tables, where each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). It is widely used due to its simplicity, flexibility, and support for SQL-based queries.</p>



                        <h3>7. Define primary key and foreign key.</h3>
                        <p>Primary Key: A field (or combination of fields) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Key: A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3>8. What is normalization? List its first three normal forms.</h3>
                        <p>Normalization is a design process used to organize data in a database to minimize redundancy and improve integrity. The first three normal forms are:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>1NF: Eliminates repeating groups and ensures atomicity.</li>
                          <li>2NF: Removes partial dependencies on composite primary keys.</li>
                          <li>3NF: Eliminates transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        
                        <h3>9. What is the difference between centralized and distributed databases?</h3>
                        <p>Centralized Database: Stored at a single location, easier to manage, but vulnerable to single-point failures.</p>
                        <p>Distributed Database: Spread across multiple locations, more reliable and scalable, but harder to manage and maintain.</p>
                        

                        <h3>10. What are domain, entity integrity, and referential integrity constraints?</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Domain Constraint: Ensures values fall within a valid range or type.</li>
                          <li>Entity Integrity: Requires primary keys to be unique and not null.</li>
                          <li>Referential Integrity: Ensures foreign keys correctly reference existing records.</li>
                        </ul>
